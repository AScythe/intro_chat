---

## Global Setup (One-Time Per Machine)

These steps run **once per machine** — not per repo. They configure your AI coding assistant and MCP tooling globally.

### 1. Install OpenCode CLI

```powershell
npm install -g opencode-ai
```

Verify:

```powershell
opencode --version
```

### 2. Configure OpenCode Global Permissions

Create `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json`:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "lsp": true,
  "agent": {
    "build": {
      "permission": {
        "edit": "ask",
        "write": "ask",
        "bash": "ask"
      }
    },
    "plan": {
      "permission": {
        "edit": "deny",
        "write": "deny",
        "bash": "ask"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

- Build-mode: asks before editing, writing, or running shell commands.
- Plan-mode: edit and write are **denied** (physically blocked); bash prompts for approval.

### 3. Install MCP Servers

**cocoindex-code** (semantic code search):

```powershell
uv tool install 'cocoindex-code[full]'
```

The `[full]` extra bundles local sentence-transformers embeddings (no API key required). The `ccc` CLI is provided by this package.

**graphify** (knowledge graph):

```powershell
pip install 'graphifyy[mcp]'
```

> Note: The PyPI package is `graphifyy` (double-y). The import module is `graphify`. Use `pip install` (not `uv tool install`) so the module is importable by `python -m graphify.serve`.

### 4. Add uv Tool Binaries to PATH

Both `ccc` and `graphify` executables are installed to `~/.local/bin/` by uv, but this directory is not on PATH by default on Windows.

```powershell
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable(
    "Path",
    [Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("Path", "User") + ";$env:USERPROFILE\.local\bin",
    "User"
)
```

Open a **new terminal** for this to take effect. Verify:

```powershell
ccc --help
graphify --help
```

### 5. Set Default Embedding Model for cocoindex-code

The file `~/.cocoindex_code/global_settings.yml` is auto-created by `ccc init`. Recommended config (local embeddings, no API key):

```yaml
embedding:
  provider: sentence-transformers
  model: sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2
```

To switch models, edit this file and run `ccc doctor` to verify.

---

## Project Setup (Per Repository Clone)

These steps run for **each clone** of the project.

### 1. Clone Repository

```powershell
git clone <repository-url>
cd [project-name]
```

### 2. Install OpenCode Plugin Dependencies

```powershell
cd .opencode
npm install
cd ..
```

This installs `@opencode-ai/plugin` and `opencode-ast-grep` — the AST-based structural search and rewrite tool.

### 3. Initialize cocoindex-code Index

```powershell
ccc init
ccc index
```

- `ccc init` creates `.cocoindex_code/settings.yml` with file patterns for indexing
- `ccc index` builds the semantic search index (incremental after first build)
- `.cocoindex_code/` is gitignored — rebuild on each clone
- `graphify-out/*.json`, `GRAPH_REPORT.md`, and `graph.html` are excluded from cocoindex's `exclude_patterns` — graph data is queried via the graphify MCP server, not semantic search

### 4. Build the Knowledge Graph

```powershell
graphify update .
```

This creates `graphify-out/` with:
- `graph.json` — full knowledge graph data
- `graph.html` — interactive visualization
- `GRAPH_REPORT.md` — architecture insights

### 5. (No Action Needed) Graphify is Pre-Configured

Graphify usage rules are already committed in `AGENTS.md` and the MCP server is registered in root `opencode.json`. No post-clone step required.

> The `graphify opencode install` command exists but is not needed — it creates an optional plugin reminder that is redundant with AGENTS.md rules.

### opencode.json (Project Root)

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "plugin": ["opencode-ast-grep"],
  "permission": {
    "skill": {
      "*": "allow"
    }
  },
  "mcp": {
    "cocoindex-code": {
      "type": "local",
      "command": ["ccc", "mcp"]
    },
    "graphify": {
      "type": "local",
      "command": ["python", "-m", "graphify.serve", "graphify-out/graph.json"]
    }
  }
}
```

> **Permissions:** The project-level `opencode.json` controls plugins, MCP servers, and skill permissions. Build-mode permissions (edit/write/bash) are set globally at `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json` (see [§2](#2-configure-opencode-global-permissions)). To override per-project, add an `agent.build.permission` block to the root `opencode.json`.

### Agentic Workflow Skills

The `.opencode/skills/` directory contains 20 skills implementing a Agentic Development pipeline (21 with the auto-generated `graphify` skill in `AGENTS.md`):

| Phase | Skill | Mode |
|-------|-------|------|
| 1 | `brainstorm-and-plan` | Plan |
| 2 | `grill-and-refine` | Plan |
| 3 | `check-plan-readiness` | Build |
| 4 | `implement-plan` | Build |
| 5 | `review-implementation` | Build |
| 6 | `improve-architecture` | Build |
| 7 | `modularize-and-clean` | Build |
| 8 | `update-docs` | Build |
| 9 | `push-to-git` | Build |
| — | `run-e2e-tests` | Build |
| — | `update-agent-setup-md` | Build |
| — | `update-agents-md` | Build |
| — | `update-architecture-md` | Build |

| — | `rebuild-test-and-indexes` | Build |
| — | `save-session` | Build |
| — | `frontend-design` | Plan |
| — | `shadcn` | Build |

Skills are auto-loaded by OpenCode when the task description matches their `name` and `description` fields.

### Gitignore Configuration

**Principle:** Track what's essential for setup (configs, dependencies, manifests). Ignore what's regeneratable (build output, caches, indexes, internal metadata).

#### Root `.gitignore` — Tool-Related Rules

| Rule | Tool | Why Ignored |
|------|------|-------------|
| `.opencode/node_modules/` | OpenCode plugins | Regeneratable via `npm install` in `.opencode/` |
| `/.cocoindex_code/` | cocoindex-code | Platform-specific index tied to local Python env; recreated by `ccc init && ccc index` |
| `graphify-out/manifest.json` | graphify | mtime-based cache metadata — breaks after git clone |
| `graphify-out/cost.json` | graphify | Local API cost tracking — not shareable across machines |
| `graphify-out/cache/` | graphify | AST extraction cache — regenerated by `graphify update .` |
| `graphify-out/.graphify_labels.json` | graphify | Internal metadata — regenerated on rebuild |
| `graphify-out/.graphify_root` | graphify | Internal metadata — regenerated on rebuild |

> **Note:** `graphify-out/graph.json`, `graphify-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md`, and `graphify-out/graph.html` are **tracked** (shared across machines). Only caches and metadata are ignored. These graph output files are also excluded from cocoindex-code's semantic index (via `settings.yml` `exclude_patterns`) — graph queries use the graphify MCP server, not vector search.

#### Nested `.opencode/.gitignore`

```gitignore
node_modules
bun.lock
```

Only `node_modules` and `bun.lock` are ignored here. The files `package.json` and `package-lock.json` are **tracked** — they define the exact plugin dependency versions so every clone gets identical OpenCode plugin behavior.

#### Why Not Commit Generated Files

- `.cocoindex_code/` is tied to your Python environment and absolute file paths — an index built on Windows won't work on Mac or Linux. Run `ccc init && ccc index` on each machine instead.
- `graphify-out/cache/` and metadata files (`.graphify_labels.json`, `.graphify_root`) are AST extraction artifacts unique to the local environment. The committed graph (`graph.json`, `GRAPH_REPORT.md`, `graph.html`) is the shareable output.
- `graphify-out/manifest.json` stores mtime-based hashes that change after clone — committing it would cause false rebuilds.

## Custom Commands

### `/scaffold`

Creates new OpenCode skills and commands from templates. Defined at `.opencode/commands/scaffold.md` (project-level).

Usage:

| Command | Creates | Location |
|---------|---------|----------|
| `/scaffold skill <name>` | Skill definition | `.opencode/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` |
| `/scaffold command <name>` | Command prompt | `.opencode/commands/<name>.md` |
| `/scaffold global-skill <name>` | Global skill | `~/.config/opencode/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` |
| `/scaffold global-command <name>` | Global command | `~/.config/opencode/commands/<name>.md` |

Each template includes frontmatter (`name`, `description`) and a base workflow structure. After generation, the file can be edited to customize behavior.

## First-Time Flow From Scratch

Complete end-to-end setup on a new machine:

### Step 1: Install System Prerequisites

```powershell
# Install Python 3.10+ from https://python.org
# Install Node.js 18+ from https://nodejs.org

# Install uv
powershell -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"

# Install OpenCode CLI
npm install -g opencode-ai

# Reload PATH
$env:Path = [Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("Path", "Machine") + ";" + [Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("Path", "User")
```

### Step 2: Set Up MCP Servers

```powershell
uv tool install 'cocoindex-code[full]'
pip install 'graphifyy[mcp]'

# Add uv tool bin directory to PATH
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("Path", "$env:Path;$env:USERPROFILE\.local\bin", "User")

# Open a NEW terminal for PATH change to take effect
```

### Step 3: Install OpenCode Global Config

Create `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json` (see [section 2](#2-configure-opencode-global-permissions) above).

### Step 4: Clone and Set Up Project

```powershell
git clone <repository-url>
cd [project-name]

# OpenCode plugin dependencies
cd .opencode
npm install
cd ..
```

### Step 5: Initialize Tooling

```powershell
ccc init
ccc index
graphify update .
```

### Step 6: Restart OpenCode

Restart your OpenCode session. Both MCP servers should connect automatically.

## Replicating to Another Project

To reuse this project's agent development environment in a **new project** (not a clone of a repo that already has it), manually copy the following files from a source project that already has them set up.

### Instructions

1. **Create the directory structure** in your new project:
   ```
    .opencode/skills/
    .opencode/commands/
    tests/
    refs/
    ```

2. **Copy skills** — From the source project's `.opencode/skills/`, copy every `<skill-name>/SKILL.md` folder into your new project's `.opencode/skills/`. Keep the same folder structure.

3. **Copy commands** — From the source project's `.opencode/commands/`, copy every `.md` file into your new project's `.opencode/commands/`.

4. **Copy OpenCode plugin manifests** — From the source project's `.opencode/`, copy `package.json` and `package-lock.json` into your new project's `.opencode/`.

5. **Copy agent guidelines test** — From the source project's `tests/`, copy `test_agent_guidelines.py` into your new project's `tests/`.

6. **Copy reference documents** — From the source project's `refs/`, copy all `.md` files (`AGENT_SETUP.md`, `PROJECT_BEST_PRACTICES.md`, `DOCUMENT_GUIDELINES.md`) into your new project's `refs/`.

7. **Copy project config** — From the source project root, copy `opencode.json` into your new project's root.

   > **Verify MCP format after copy:** Ensure the `"mcp"` key is used (not `"mcpServers"`) and each server has `"type": "local"` with a `"command"` array (not `"command"` + `"args"`). See the [reference config](#opencodejson-project-root) above for the correct shape.

8. **Add gitignore rules** — Append these tool-related rules to your new project's `.gitignore`:
   ```gitignore
   .opencode/node_modules/
   /.cocoindex_code/
   graphify-out/manifest.json
   graphify-out/cost.json
   graphify-out/cache/
    graphify-out/.graphify_labels.json
    graphify-out/.graphify_root
    ```

9. **Copy `.graphifyignore`** — If `.graphifyignore` exists in the source project, copy it to the new project root. It filters low-signal files (caches, dependencies, archives) from the knowledge graph.

10. **Copy `agent_utility/`** — Copy the entire `agent_utility/` directory from the source project to the new project root. Contains graph maintenance scripts (`filter_graph.py`, `enhance_graph_viewer.py`, `dedup_graph_nodes.py`) that are invoked by the `rebuild-test-and-indexes` skill.

### Post-Copy Setup

After copying the files, run the standard [Project Setup](#project-setup-per-repository-clone) steps (install dependencies, init CocoIndex, build Graphify).

---

## Verification

After setup, confirm each component works:

```powershell
# OpenCode
opencode --version

# cocoindex-code (semantic search)
ccc mcp --help

# graphify (knowledge graph) via CLI
graphify --version

# graphify (knowledge graph) via MCP
python -m graphify.serve graphify-out/graph.json &

# cocoindex index status
ccc status
```

In OpenCode itself, verify:
- The ast-grep plugin is loaded (structural search works)
- Both MCP servers connect without errors on startup
- Skills are listed (skills matching current task description are suggested)

---

## Troubleshooting

### `ccc` or `graphify` command not found

The uv tool binaries are in `~/.local/bin/` but this directory is not on PATH by default on Windows.

**Fix:** Run once:

```powershell
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("Path", "$env:Path;$env:USERPROFILE\.local\bin", "User")
```

Then open a **new terminal**.

### `python -m graphify.serve` fails with ModuleNotFoundError

graphifyy was installed via `uv tool install` instead of `pip install`. The `uv tool install` isolates the package from system Python.

**Fix:**

```powershell
pip install 'graphifyy[mcp]'
```

### `ccc mcp` fails on OpenCode startup

**Cause:** OpenCode was started before `~/.local/bin` was added to PATH. Child processes inherit the parent's environment, so even if the user PATH is set in the registry, already-running processes and their children won't see it.

**Fix:** Run `ccc --help` in a new terminal. If it works, the PATH is correct — restart your OpenCode host (Cursor, VS Code, terminal) so it picks up the new environment. If `ccc --help` fails, re-run the PATH setup step in [§4](#4-add-uv-tool-binaries-to-path) and open a fresh terminal.

If you genuinely cannot modify PATH (restricted machine), fall back to an absolute path in `opencode.json`:
```json
"cocoindex-code": {
  "type": "local",
  "command": ["C:\\Users\\<YOUR_USERNAME>\\.local\\bin\\ccc.exe", "mcp"]
}
```
But note: absolute paths are **machine-specific** — they break when the same repository is cloned on a different device. Prefer bare `"ccc"` (PATH-based) for portability.

### Graph is stale or has no data

Run:

```powershell
graphify update .
```

This re-extracts the project and rebuilds the knowledge graph.

### Graphify on Windows

**`UnicodeEncodeError` when running `graphify` commands**

```powershell
$env:PYTHONIOENCODING='utf-8'; graphify update .
```

This affects PowerShell 5.1 on Windows where stdout defaults to the system code page (e.g., cp1252).

**Graphify runs fine locally but CI reports `graphify: command not found`**

CI environments typically don't have graphifyy installed. This is expected — graphify is used for *human-guided* architecture review, not automated CI checks. The committed graph (`graph.json`) is the shareable artifact.

### CocoIndex on Windows

**`ccc doctor` fails with `UnicodeEncodeError`**

Same fix:

```powershell
$env:PYTHONIOENCODING='utf-8'; ccc doctor
```

Prepend `$env:PYTHONIOENCODING='utf-8'` before `ccc doctor` on Windows PowerShell to resolve `UnicodeEncodeError`.

### `.cocoindex_code/settings.yml` doesn't exist

Run `ccc init` in the project root to create it, then `ccc index` to build the index.
